#Exercise 1: Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse the
#“From” lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number of messages from each person using a dictionary.
#After all the data has been read, print the person with the most commits
#by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then
#sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the most
#commits.
