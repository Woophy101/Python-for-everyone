#Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt
#Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as
#keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you
#can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the
#dictionary
