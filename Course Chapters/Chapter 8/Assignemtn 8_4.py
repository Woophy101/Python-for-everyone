#8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line,
#split the line into a list of words using the split() method.
#The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check
#to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list.
#When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical
#order.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt
